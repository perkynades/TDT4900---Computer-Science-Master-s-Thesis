\section{Non-functional requirements}
\textit{Participant \#1} describing that software quality is related to non-functional requirements, such as usability, maintainability, performance, security, or the mutability of the software's architecture. 

\textit{Participant \#1} explained that a team of software consultant once was delivered a list of over 250 non-functional requirements which the intended system had to maintain. Such a long list of requirements being difficult to control that the requirements are actually followed, being even more difficult to actually implement the requirements.

\textit{Participant \#2} describing software quality as a piece of software being made in such a way that it is robust. And that it is made so that it is easy for other programmers to modify, maintain and repair if it is needed.

\textit{Participant \#4} has similar reflections on non-functional requirements. However also focus on the manageability of the software being created, that it should be long lasting and be able to be modified over a longer span of time. Also describing that a piece of software is not dependant on 1 person, but the whole developing it. 

\textit{Participant \#5} describing that NAV has called non-functional requirements as quality requirements or quality properties. Something which was done in the past. Also explaining quality as testable or maintainable.

\textit{Participant \#7} explaining that in the technical quality of software, some non-functional requirements are more important than others, such as manageability, functionality, usability, maintainability being more important to focus on than other non-functional requirements. 

\textit{Participant \#8} relating to the reflections of \textit{Participant \#2} in that a piece of software should be easy to modify, and that the software's code should be readable and quick to understand how it functions by just reading it.

\textit{Participant \#9} explained that he had worked with software quality, but measuring it up against the ISO standards. Including measuring it up against non-functional requirements such as usability, security, reusability etc. 

\textit{Participant \#11} describing good usability as important in software quality, that the user should feel that a piece of software is of quality, the visual aspect is perceived as attractive. Also describing software quality is that piece of software is stable, secure and robust.

\section{Agile}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that by using agile methods you demonstrate the software being developed, and at each demonstration feedback will be given about the software quality.

\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that in agile methods it is primarily a customer which is receiving a product, and that it is primarily the product owner which follows the development team, and must be able to give feedback on the most important aspects in software quality, and if it is good enough.

\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that in agile methods, it is meant to be used as a method to maintain high software quality throughout the lifetime of the software. That you should not compromise on quality to quickly finish a feature, instead compromising on the amount of user stories or features of the software.

\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that in NAV's project to develop an new system for distributing parental benefits, most agile practices were followed in order to obtain good quality in the systems software.

\textit{Participant \#3} describing that software quality does not have so much to do with ISO standards, but being able for a team to be able to change in their development of a system. Setting ability to change as similarities to quality in the software NAV creates. This because the development teams might not know what is correct or best when developing software in a world which is always changing. The development teams does not want any faults in their software, however since the world around the software is always changing, the teams have to guard against eventual faults and ensure that the consequences are as low as possible.

\textit{Participant \#8} describing that software quality is described quite simply, how simple is it to modify the software. Also describing that in Skatteetaten agile methods to ensure quality, including delivering MVP's of the software and ensuring that their software delivers as expected.

\textit{Participant \#9} explaining that an important measure to ensuring software quality is development speed. What is happening in the development of a piece of software and how is new releases published.

\textit{Participant \#9} explaining that Mattilsynet could have better routines for assuring quality in its software. However Mattilsynet is a young organisation when it comes to software development and is currently most focused on development speed for its new product teams and focus on productivity and releasing solutions, instead of quality and testing. It will then become a challenge to change from this focus on development speed to quality, testing and managing its software.

\section{Simulation}
\textit{Participant \#1} describing that in the "Perform project" at the Norwegian Public Service Pension fund extra systems for testing their solution with simulated data. While at the development of the new system for distributing parental benefits at NAV, more traditional methods were used to test the system with simulated data.

\section{Security}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that at the development of the new system for distributing parental benefits at NAV, in the beginning specific persons had the responsibility for security. The project was done in 2019, and at that point each team had a specific person with knowledge in security. 

\textit{Participant \#1} describing that at the "Perform project" at the Norwegian Public Service Pension fund had central in it project organisation requirements for security, which the development teams had to take into account.

\textit{Participant \#7} explaining that Skatteetaten takes requirements related to security seriously. Skatteetaten is constantly exposed to cyber attacks, so their requirements on quality related to secure software has always been strict. Thus due to a lack of development resources, means that Skatteetaten has to prioritise security over functionalities for its users, meaning that they will have to make do with something a little simpler or which includes more manual work.

\textit{Participant \#7} describing that the focus on security is the same at NAV, as at Skatteetaten.

\textit{Participant \#8} explaining that at Skatteetaten, everything is logged. If someone looks up something, does a network call, we log that person doing it. Audit-logging is also done for direct lookups to a database, so that if you have the correct right's, then you will be logged and exposed.

\textit{Participant \#9} explaining that at Mattilsynet a lot of ROS analasys is done to ensure quality in secruity, the ROS does also work as a more general ensuring of quality in the software being analysed.

\section{Inspection}
\textit{Participant \#1} describing that at the "Perform project" at the Norwegian Public Service Pension fund, they used code inspection as a tool to ensure quality.

\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that some are critical to some inspection techniques, due to it being time consuming. A developer has to stop what they are doing to look at a other developers code, review it, give their thoughts, send in a review, and repeat the process. After the code is approved, the developer then has to spend time on returning to what he/she was working on before, which leaves the whole process to take up to multiple days. If the developers instead had been pair-programming, the code would be inspected then and there.

\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that a study from Microsoft found that there were only a few critical faults that were found in code inspections. Mostly faults relating to code style were found, not so much critical faults.

\textit{Participant \#1} describing that it is their belief that many teams does code inspections, and in some organisations the code has to be inspected before it is allowed to be merged into the code repository.

\textit{Participant \#10} explaining that they have increased the use of static code analysis at Mattilsynet. And had recently scanned a large old system by using SonarQube which he believes to have found about 145 critical faults. This enables Mattilsynet to know that these faults exists and that they can start fixing them, which is a huge step from not knowing that they exist. 

\textit{Participant \#10} explaining that when it comes to inspection through monitoring and monitoring metrics, it is a bit weak at Mattilsynet, the participant further explaining that he is used to a higher standard at places such as Norsk Tipping.

\section{DevOps}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that there has been done studies on the difference of demonstration of deployment of software. And the studies concluding with the customer and users finding more faults when the software is deployed, instead of in demonstrations. This because when the piece of software is being presented in an demonstration, the context is artificial. The user testing the software does not get to experience if it works in their own organisation or how it works with other tools used in their normal life. Hence a other kind of quality is tested when the software is deployed and available to the user in their normal context.

\textit{Participant \#1} further explaining that NAV uses continuous deployment to gain feedback on its software. And in the project for parental benefits, the project was initially planned to be three large deployments, however for the last deployment the project switched tactics. For the last deployment, where teams were combined with both development and management resources, where continuously deployment was performed. And thinking that this gave the teams more control, due to the feedback from the users being more authentic on a wider range of quality aspects.

\textit{Participant \#3} explaining that in the development of software, the negative consequences has to be as low as possible. This needs have to be handled with continuous delivery. In the past, NAV had 4 big releases every year, where the largest release had about 116 000 development hours. The only way to ensure that 116 000 development hours does not cause negative consequences is to do 
 a lot of manual testing, a lot of check lists. However NAV believes that doing more frequent releases will decrease the consequences of an eventual fault. This is why NAV has gone from 4 releases a year to 1500 releases a week.

\textit{Participant \#4} explaining that to ensure the development of robust software it needs to be continuously developed. If not maintained it will naturally decrease in quality. Also explaining that in order to create software of quality, speed and good flow is needed for the development teams. The teams at NAV follows the DevOps principles.

\textit{Participant \#4} explaining that NAV has their own application platform, NAIS. NAIS is designed in a way which gives strong recommendations on how software should be developed and deployed to NAV's infrastructure. The sum of NAIS is that it makes it easier to create software at NAV, which increases quality. The teams at NAV are not forced to follow the recommendations of NAIS, however are encourage to make good decisions. These are important incentives for the teams to operate the software they develop, as this increases quality.

\textit{Participant \#4} also explaining that to increase quality it is important to be able to fix faults quickly. Faults will always happen, so it is important to be able to fix these faults quickly.

\textit{Participant \#5} explaining that NAV has a whole range of software, from COBOL software which is deployed to mainframes, to software deployed to the NAIS platform. NAV works the most with software that is deployed to the NAIS platform, where the platform itself maintains a higher level of quality by introducing standardised services and expectations on how software should be deployed.

\textit{Participant \#7} explaining that at Skatteetaten, the teams themselves has the responsibility of delivering production ready software, where from 2013 they have worked with continuously deploying production ready software. And deploying code that is at user-story level, not at the delivery level. All of this to deliver production ready software as early as possible. If there are any faults, it is most likely of limited scope, and the team is able to quickly roll back to an earlier version of the software and can fix the fault quickly. This in contrast to large and infrequent releases, where large acceptance tests are needed, which gives large faults.

\textit{Participant \#10} explaning that if not looking at its older software, Mattilsynets newer software is build using the micro-services or service-oriented architecture. The software is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, which gives a declarative way of deploying software. Mattilsynet has a set of requirements for their software to be deployed to their cluster. The code has to be on GitHub and part of Mattilsynet's GitHub organisation, so that their platform team knows what it is, what it does and then can scan it for different reasons.

\section{Architecture}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that in agile methods there should not be a head of architecture who controls everything. Rather the head of architect should have dialogue with each team and should with the teams agree on good architectural decisions. 

\textit{Participant \#7} explaining that Skatteetaten as a different strategy and a higher architecture than NAV has. Skatteetaten has an increased focus on common components or the re-use of components. When having a high degree of reuse, it lets Skatteetaten get more quickly done with certain tasks.

\section{Team}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that it is the environment who is creating the solution who should have opinions on what is good software quality in the context of the solution they are creating.

\textit{Participant \#1} also explaining that in the larger project, there has been sub-projects which has focused on software quality. With people with knowledge in testing techniques and testing tools working both with the team and outside the team.

\textit{Participant \#2} explaining that at Entur is based on that their development teams should be autonomous and decide what should be done at what point in a project. Assuming that this includes the assurance of software quality is part of the team, and the team can therefore decide what methods they should use to assure quality.

\textit{Participant \#2} also explaining it is the teams themselves that have the responsibility on what methods should be used to assuring quality dependant on the context which they are in.

\textit{Participant \#2} also explaining that assurance of quality might have been a more formal part of software development, when the software development process was more defined, like in the waterfall model. Now it has changed to development teams choose themselves what should be prioritised and what is important. Further suspecting that this change has led to software quality assurance being prioritised lower and is seen as less important. The development teams instead thinking that if the users are happy, then the software is of high quality.

\textit{Participant \#2} also explaining that he does not know if any teams have a person which is responsible for quality assurance. However the teams has a for example a product owner or designers which have the user in mind, and that the user should feel that the software is usable and valuable. Further stating that it could be a challenge that the responsibility is not placed on a single person, however there is a responsibility throughout the team.

\textit{Participant \#5} explaining that NAV has changed from centralised requirements and check-lists to where there is no centralised management. It is up to each team to understand how the software they develop function. Management trusts that the teams has the best knowledge of their product and can create good products.

\textit{Participant \#6} explaining that if a piece of software is large enough to need more than one person, the need for software quality assurance increases. Thus the quality assurance needs to be adapted to the people who own the software and how the team developing it co-operate. 

\textit{Participant \#6} also explaining that NAV is making efforts to make it easier for the development teams to change, test and own the software they are developing or maintaining.

\textit{Participant \#8} explaining that at Skatteetaten the teams are cross-functional. Each team has a member responsible for the architecture and that it follows the guidelines and patterns which are approved in Skatteetaten. There is a also a member responsible for security which makes sure that the has good security in their product. These is a also a member which have the responsibility of DevOps who makes sure that the CI/CD pipeline is properly configured. The teams does also have a product owner, which is responsible for choosing what should be prioritised and what should be done at what times. There are also members who are representing the organisational and making sure the organisational requirements are met. There is also a member who has an extra focus on testing and testing related activities. Roles such as security and testing responsible does not have the full responsibility for this, they are only supposed to make sure that it happens, the whole development team is responsible for these activities. 

\textit{Participant \#10} explaining that Mattilsynet has recently done a big job of moving away from project based development to product-teams. This is making Mattilsynet solve their strategic problems by making sure that in the highest degree possible, the correct problems are being solved. This helping solving the issue of having software that is high in quality, but does not solve the correct problems, which are not useful. Thus switching to product-teams has been an important decisions and making sure the product-teams are well looked after.

\textit{Participant \#10} also explaining that the teams at Mattilsynet has about 10-11 product-teams with great autonomy, with no centralised authority for architecture. This is something which Mattilsynet might implement very shortly, as it is becoming to be a problem that there is no centralised authority for architecture, and the problem is only going to grow. However the strategy for now is simple increasing the velocity of the product-teams before giving the product-teams the direction, and instead iterating the project-teams as new problems arise.

\textit{Participant \#10} also explaining that there are no boundaries in the choice of technology etc by the product-teams. However when recruiting new developers, a skill in a certain set of programming languages are preferred, such as Kotlin/TypeScript. The product-teams will not get any pushback from choosing a language which is not widely deployed at Mattilsynet, but the team must be prepared to have good arguments for why they made the particular choice. This has been a deliberate choice, as it should be easy to follow the "main path" at Mattilsynet, but not making any hard borders on what is allowed, so that the product-teams can experiment, as hindering this slows town the development velocity. However going beyond the "main path" is going to increase costs, so the product-teams needs to bear this increased costs, this motivating the product teams not to just experiment without having a good justification.

\textit{Participant \#10} also explaining that the product-teams at Mattilsynet has a mix of consultants and permanent employees, no longer having teams purely consisting of consultants. This ensures that both consultants and permanent employees understands the costs of creating long-lasting software. This due to Mattilsynet having experiences with consultants not taking into account the costs of maintaining a software when creating it.

\textit{Participant \#10} also explaining that the product-teams at Mattilsynet are set up to be long lasting and there is no plan for these teams to be dissolved, which is a view shared by the leadership of the IT-department of Mattilsynet. This ensures that the teams most familiar with the software have a long-term ownership and responsibility for that software. Thus ensuring that any technical debts are decreased.

\textit{Participant \#11} explaining that Mattilsynet develop their software on different levels, that each product-team has a tech lead which has the main responsibility for the technical quality. Mattilsynet also have a tech lead forum for all tech leads at Mattilsynet to increase knowledge sharing between all the tech leads.

\textit{Participant \#11} also explaining that Mattilsynet has discussed a range of governance-principles which each team have to deal with. These principles include things such as security, archive-law and GDPR. However the product teams are quite new, and has a high percentage of newly employed members, so Mattilsynet is currently only focusing on governance-principles which are required by Norwegian public sector agencies by Norwegian law, these being GDPR and security.
To help with this, Mattilsynet has a central team for security which works closely with the platform team to create a good security foundation for the product teams. 

\section{Testing}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that most agencies in the Norwegian public sector use regression testing to test their software, and are trying to automate as much as possible in testing. However some testing is still done manually, such as exploitative testing and having the customer involved in the testing activities.

\textit{Participant \#3} explaining that continuous delivery is something which takes a lot of effort to get working properly, which includes writing tests. Tests are being written to make sure that there is a web of security around the software being created, so that the chance of something faulty being delivered is a low as possible. The chance of faults will never be 0, but trying to get it as low as possible within reason. 

\textit{Participant \#4} explaining that in order to deploying smaller and more frequent changes to a piece of software, automated quality checks are needed.

\textit{Participant \#6} explaining that in order to create software that is able to change a lot has to be in place, such as testing. Testing being the most important measure to make sure that a piece of software can change over time.

\textit{Participant \#7} explaining that Skatteetaten have a high degree of automated tests, and do perform any accepts tests, which were years since last were done. Skatteetaten has also experimented with the use of automated testing, such as the amount of automated tests being written is the correct amount. If to many are written it becomes a large task to maintain all the automated tests. So it has been a challenge for Skatteetaten to find the balancing point on what is the right amount of automated tests.

\textit{Participant \#8} explaining that to be able to change a piece of software, the software needs to have a high test coverage. A method is tested on the lower level with unit-tests, then the whole unit or application which the method is a part of is tested. If using a microservice architecture where there is interaction and values between the application, then testing is needed at all levels. This to ensure that everything works as intended and changes in a piece of software does not lead to any faults which leads to the software crashing.

\section{Technical Debt}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that being able to register technical debt can be important for software quality as it enables knowledge in what should be done in the future and having knowledge on potential vulnerabilities in a system.

\textit{Participant \#3} explaining that NAV has a large variety of software in their organisation. Some software is over 40 years old, while some is being created from the ground up now and all software in-between. And this variety in age of software means that NAV has to have different methods for how changes in its software is done, based on that piece of software. If the software is old, maybe 20 years old, manual testing is needed and a full test environment is needed, thus creating a lot of overhead which prohibits securing quality in the software. This leads to the need for modernisation of the old software, which for NAV means creating new software and turning off the old.

\textit{Participant \#3} also explaining that NAV is trying to save old systems without turning them off, instead modernising them while still in service. The system for delivering pension benefits was created by consultants from 2007 to 2011, and which in 2017 was described as technical bankrupt. "It took half a year to change a comma". However by working at it and improving for five years and is now able to have changes to the system deployed daily. Creating software with the ability to change is important, it does not matter how much testing has been done upfront, the needs of the system will change from when it was ordered to when it goes live, and after it has gone live.

\textit{Participant \#4} explaining that maintaining software is an issue. The development teams should use 20-25\% of their time on improve technical debt, as technical debt is the opposite of software quality. The challenge is to make the development teams spend so much time on technical debt.

\textit{Participant \#5} explaining that NAV has a challenge with old systems without automated tests, requiring more manual quality assurance methods. These systems also have a lower rate of deploys, such as the system for delivering daily allowance benefits, called ARENA. It has gone from 4 deploys a year to 12 deploys. The frequency of deploys has increased some, but are still in-frequent due to the need for more manual quality checks.

\textit{Participant \#8} explaining that Skatteetaen has some old software, and it is the re-writing and renewing of these systems that is a challenge in bad quality. The new systems that Skatteetaten is creating is of good quality, but the old has some quality issues. So the old software is being modernised bit by bit, and is turned of as they are being modernised.  

\textit{Participant \#9} explaining that Mattilsynet has some older systems, however with the new product-teams organisation, it has given a better focus on this old software. The new systems are made with better quality, however there are still issues with quality in the older systems.

\textit{Participant \#10} explaining that a Gartner-report on Mattilsynet's system "Mats" i 2012 explained that the system will cost Mattilsynet 10 Billion NOK over the next 15 years from 2012. That money does not exist, so Mattilsynet cannot let that happen. However the consequences of this is that the system looses its functionality as time goes on, just from the world around it changing. "Mats" has integration with other systems in the Norwegian public sector. A data format from the Norwegian Directorate of Agriculture changed led to "Mats" loosing functionality, due to Mattilsynet being unable to update "Mats" to accept the new data format.

\textit{Participant \#11} explaining that Mattilsynet has older software which are good in quality when it comes to downtime and other operational requirements. However they are lacking in quality when it comes to technical debt and usability. The new applications of Mattilsynet has better usability and has overall better quality.

\section{Knowledge}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that the Norwegian public sector participates in conferences to discuss competence development for their agencies. It is not only the larger agencies such as NAV and Skattetaten who attend such conferences, but other agencies in the Norwegian public sector.

\textit{Participant \#4} explaining that the sharing of knowledge is important for assuring quality in software, as well as high competence throughout a organisation is important for software quality.  

\textit{Participant \#6} explaining that competency can be a challenge. It is quite clear that the people with the least experience in software development has little knowledge in testing or continuous delivery, so these have to be trained in such things.

\textit{Participant \#7} explaining that the people maintaining Skatteetatens older IT-system does not have the competency needed to develop and maintaining their newer software. These people usually work with stuff like Oracle databases do not know how to create a user-story or create a Java component. Skatteetaten need a different competency than that as there is a large change in their modernisation plans.

\section{Method}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that there is little difference in the methods that the Norwegian public sector and the Norwegian private sector use in the development of their software.

\textit{Participant \#1} also explaining that at the "Perform project" at the Norwegian pension fund, pair-programming was used as a software development method. However not all development teams in the Norwegian public sector perform pair-programming, but pair-programming is done for the more complex tasks. The development teams do make sure that all team members has pair-programmed in an development iteration. This has the effect of increasing ownership in the code the team is developing, which prevents future faults and the development team has a better understanding of how all the code function.

\textit{Participant \#1} also explaining that at NAV software teaming or mob-programming is used, meaning that the whole development team sit together and write code. This enables more discussion about the code than by using pair-programming. This also has the effect of increasing knowledge in the whole development team.

\textit{Participant \#2} explaining that software developers are using agile methods to ensure quality in their software by releasing it to the user, and seeing if the user gains any value from the software. These principles are used at NAV and Entur, which focuses MVP's and let the user test the MVP's. If the user do not care about a feature, NAV and Entur do not care either. By repeating this with their users, NAV and Entur ensure high quality in their software.

\textit{Participant \#5} explaining that through NAV's technical direction, which describes what methods are desired in software development. This describes that pair-programming is preferred and it recommends that the development teams to it as often as possible. It also recommends focus on test-driven development and focus on test coverage in the development teams.

\textit{Participant \#7} explaining that he thinks that the traditional ISO-mindset controls the quality of software after it has been created. For the last 15 years at Skattetaten the mindset has been that the control of software quality should be done from the start, instead of doing it after the fact.

\textit{Participant \#7} also explaining that Skatteetaten has a method-framework which explains the best practice in software development and describes what working patterns should be followed. This is then added as part of the developments teams methods and is communicated to share experience on it. It is not seen as a method just for the methods sake, but is used as a way to share knowledge.

\textit{Participant \#7} also explaining that part of Skatteetatens development patterns is doing things in the right order and having a good work flow, that competency is used in a good way. As a software developer there might be things to get stuck on, such as not understanding logic, organisation rules, architectural decisions. In these sceniarios good quality is being preventative in making the right decisions.

\textit{Participant \#7} also explaining that to achieve good quality, cross-functional teams is needed. In software development there are a lot of aspects to think about, and it is not possible for a single person to handle all these aspects alone. Pair-programming is also recommended in assuring quality, instead of discovering faults and bad quality in tests.

\textit{Participant \#8} explaining that Skatteetaten follows certain software development methods, such as KISS (Keep it simple stupid), Clean Code and Separation of Concern. These are all used to assure good software quality.

\textit{Participant \#8} also explaining that there are several mechanisms at Skatteetaten to ensure good software quality. When developing a new function, at least 2 people have to look at the developed function, which introduces a QA-process. This and being through a test-phase is required for anything to be deployed to the production cluster. The developers never take any shortcuts. 

\textcolor{red}{Skal disse være under "Software property" ellerno?}

\textit{Participant \#9} explaining that easily accessible data is important for software to be of good quality. How data is store and retrieved in a system is important. If a systems quality should be assessed today it would be based on how its data interfaces with other applications. Today it is expected for an application to have accessible API so that its easy to get its data, and its not possible with everything that follows in good software quality such as the correct architecture and mindset on building a solution.

\textit{Participant \#10} explaining that an initiative has started at Mattilsynet when a new piece of software is created, the API is created first. This by creating API-contracts using OpenAPI, and designing the API from this. This form of API-contract creating strategy is something that the product-teams at Mattilsynet is going to start doing. This enables the product-teams to discover if an API has already been created by another team, preventing duplicate work.

\textit{Participant \#10} also explaining that the publish-subscribe pattern is used to share sets of data between applications through data-streams, both inside and outside Mattilsynet. There was a case where Nortura wanted data from Mattilsynet on what restrictions an animal has, such as what medication an animal is using. Instead of asking Mattilsynet for this data, Nortura can just retrieve one of Mattilsynets data-streams on the API-level. This also gives a loose coupling between Mattilsynet and Norturas software, meaning that Norturas systems will not crash if Mattilsynets systems are down.

\section{Project}
\textit{Participant \#1} explaining that a thing which is important for the Norwegian public sector is the Norwegian digitisation agencies project wizard, based upon PRINCE2. This project wizard is not suited for agile project, rather project following methods relating to the waterfall method. This means that you will see the methods such as the waterfall method which require more planning and defining of a project in the Norwegian public sector rather than in the Norwegian private sector.

\textit{Participant \#1} also explaining that the health platform developed for the counties in mid-Norway, was mainly created using the waterfall method, switching to an agile method later in the project. However most professionals would agree to not follow such waterfall methods, as it most of the times leads to the software quality suffering. In such projects it common to define a set of requirements, send them to multiple contractors, the contractors fight to deliver the cheapest system. Then its necessary to take some shortcuts, and if the requirements are written in a contract, it will be on the software quality. And this problem gets even larger the receiver of the project is not good at evaluation software quality. That is the problem with sending software systems on tender, it distances the requirements from the user of the system.

\textit{Participant \#1} also explaining that there are different contract models which can be used in the Norwegian public sector. Where competency is hired into an already existing development project which agencies such as NAV and Skatteetaten is doing. Here the agency are the owner and responsible part of the project, but are hiring resources need to complete the project. However this requires a higher degree of maturity in the agencies than before.

\textit{Participant \#2} explaining that the yearly budgeting in the Norwegian public sector is an issue. In the private sector if you can prove that a development project will earn money, then its easier to spend money for that development project. However in the Norwegian public sector budgets are planned yearly, so it is not easy to change how its budged should be spent to different development projects underway. If a certain software in the public sector experiences any sudden problems which needs larger funding, it will be difficult to get the necessary resources. This problem is larger for software quality, as this is not a good enough reason for changing the funding underway in a budget year or retrieving extra funding.

\textit{Participant \#2} also explaining that the issue of yearly budgets also affects the creation of new software in the Norwegian public sector. As the money is funded by the Norwegian tax payers, a development project usually do not have enough funding, hence the software quality is where it is usually saved on to fulfil the requirements of the new software.

\textit{Participant \#2} also explaining that a challenge in the Norwegian public sector is to adjust off the shelf software as a way to save money. Instead of doing it like NAV which has in-house developers who create the software themselves, and have full control of the software quality. By trying to adjust off the self software might lead to lower quality or spend a lot of resources of adjust it to a point where the users are satisfied. So there might be a divide between the parts of the Norwegian public sector which have their own development environment, so they can create high quality software themselves, and those who cannot and have to adjust off the shelf software.  

\textit{Participant \#2} also explaining that his impression that if an agency has an in-house development environment, it know that agency and their challenges quite well, so the job of adjusting off the shelf software might be easier. However when using off the shelf software, the rules of the software are already set which has to be taken into account. When building something from scratch, these rules do not apply anymore, which means that the software can be highly specified for the users needs.

\textit{Participant \#3} explaining that a lot of organisations wants to deliver software to its users like NAV has achieved. It sounds quite attractive and is spoken about in conferences, however it requires quite a lot from the organisation. Mainly it requires to not have software delivered solely from a consultants, but software developed by in-sourcing at the organisation. As soon as software is created outside the organisation and is delivered, the quality can decrease. To do as NAV it requires the organisation to take ownership in their software, however not all agencies in the Norwegian public sector have the opportunity for this.

\textit{Participant \#3} also explaining that before 2016 NAV had little knowledge or resources do develop software themselves. All systems required for NAV's operations had to be put on tenders. However NAV has stopped with this, as it is not sustainable and has negative consequences. In particular when NAV got their original system for delivering pension benefits, NAV did not know how to maintain it themselves. This meaning that NAV had to contract the maintenance and further develop the systems which are responsible for their core business, which is bad for a public sector agency.

\textit{Participant \#3} also explaining that the Norwegian digitisation agency's project wizard is a challenge for NAV and the rest of the Norwegian public sector. The project wizard which is necessary for NAV to follow to get the correct funding for their larger software proposals, has a quality assurance regime that is more suited for building roads, rather than software. The project wizard assumes a perfect understanding of the software proposed before it is created, which NAV has never had, and never will. When proposing something which will replace 40 year old software, which as been altered to fit new laws and needs through 40 years. And actually start creating the replacement, you uncover new things which could never be planned ahead of time. The fact that the funding from the project wizard stops after the software put to use is an issue. NAV wish to create software wish will live for a long time, and this requires a steady funding for development, long after the software has been put to use. This because there will always be changes in the laws surrounding NAV's software and other needs for the software, and the project wizard is not suited for such changes. This is something which is hurting NAV the most, as it has gotten the furthest in its digitisation process of the Norwegian public sector agencies. And will increase to hurt NAV as becomes better at delivering digital solutions to the citizens of Norway.

\textit{Participant \#4} explaining that before the software quality assurance was centralised at NAV. When getting delivery of a new system there would be quality assurance of the delivered software. The quality assurance was disconnected from the operations of the system. A lot of resources was used to control quality, but faults were not hindered. Today at NAV, the quality assurance is connected to the development of the software.

\textit{Participant \#4} also explaining that there are agencies in the Norwegian public sector who are following NAV's methods for improving their digitisation transformation efforts. This by rigging themselves around DevOps, product-teams and small specialised applications. Even though the the Norwegian public sector is improving, they still have some way to go to be as good as the private sector. It is worth mentioning that the agencies are not follow NAV just because NAV is successful, but because the methods NAV are using are smart trends.

\textit{Participant \#4} also explaining that there are challenges in how the development of software at NAV is financed and has a to strong dependence on project funds from the Norwegian digitisation agency project wizard. The assumption that you can plan, build and be done with the software is a faulty assumption. NAV wants to build small applications which can be iterated, and the developers can learn as they go, since you learn more about application this way than in the planning phase. The funding from the project wizard does not fit this mindset, there should instead be continuous funding.

\textit{Participant \#4} also explaining that the IT budget of NAV is set wrong. The funding should instead be put to the problem, not the technology. For NAV's case, this means increased funding for a benefit, so that the benefit can create software that it needs, rather than all the funding going under the same "IT-fund". This way the management of NAV can be more flexible with their funds on what software should be created for the benefit that needs it the most. However now it is all "unreachable" for the management and not prioritised in a way that is beneficial for NAV's users.

\textit{Participant \#5} explaining that the issue of financing might rather be an issue of prioritisation. It being a prioritisation between improving technical quality and new functionality. Thinking that its usually a discussion about financing, when in reality its an prioritisation issue, that there is to much to do, independent of the financing. Financing might not always mean that to little money, but the expectations of what should be delivered compared to the given budget being to much. And over-promising can create issues which are expensive to fix, the cleanup being expensive. So by not prioritising correctly and the wish to create as much as possible as quickly as possible and not prioritising to clean up can be an issue.

\textit{Participant \#6} explaining that NAV has gotten ahead on their digital transformation because of their focus on ownership. This being the solely use of consultants who does not have the long perspective when creating NAV's software. That the consultants think that they should create a piece of software for NAV, and then be finished. This being the opposite of good quality. As time goes on and a piece of software at NAV is not maintained, it looses quality, so you constantly have to fight against quality weathering.

\textit{Participant \#6} also explaining that NAV has a financial model which push then towards projects with a set deadline and a reduction of resources after the deadline has been reached. Both of which is bad for quality.

\textit{Participant \#6} also explaining that firmer boundaries and more trust in the financing of NAVs software would be good. Thus being able to more flexibly prioritise. It is hard to calculate money saved by using the project wizard, the rewards gained becomes an illusion. However firmer boundaries and more trust might not be smart for the Norwegian public sector, as it might lead to all agencies asking for to much funding.

\textit{Participant \#6} also explaining that the Norwegian digitisation agency's project wizard is a challenge of software quality. However it is the only way to get funding for the larger software initiatives at NAV. If not for the funding from the project wizard, NAV might had to simplify their services, leading to a reduction in what NAV can deliver for the citizens of Norway.
