\chapter*{Preface}
The following document is a case study on the practices and challenges of software quality assurance in the Norwegian public sector. Written as the master's thesis at the master's degree program in computer science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The case study was conducted by Emil Elton Nilsen, a master's student at NTNU and Software Developer at the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Organization (NAV). The master's thesis was supervised by Babak A. Farshchian, Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

I would like to thank my supervisor Babak for his honest and useful feedback during the writing of this thesis. His deep knowledge of both academic writing and digitisation in the Norwegian public sector has been highly valuable in helping me write the thesis, and guiding me throughout the process. I would also like to thank the employees at NAV who helped me with the study, especially Parastoo Mohagheghi, scientist and coordinator of science at NAV. Her help in acting as a second supervisor has been of great help in giving a second perspective on the work in the thesis.
